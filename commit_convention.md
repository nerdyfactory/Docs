### Commit convention

Basically we will follow the convention from [this](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

but having simpler rule

1. type can be `fix`, `feat`, `chore`. we can use `chore` for minor changes such as refactoring code, style fix or fixing lint errors.
2. Adding `!` if this commit is breaking change or something needs to be aware

so simplified convention will be as below

```
<type>[!]: <description>
```
